# DESMO-JS
A JavaScript port of the event-based part of the simulation framework DESMO-J (http://desmoj.sourceforge.net/)
The project has been conducted by Gerrit Greiert in the context of his master's thesis. We encourage german developers using or contributing to DESMO-JS to read it at https://github.com/TilStehle/DESMO-JS/blob/master/MastersThesisGreiert.pdf 
It describes the process of porting DESMO-J and gives concrete guidelines on how to keep DESMO-JS aligned to DESMO-J
